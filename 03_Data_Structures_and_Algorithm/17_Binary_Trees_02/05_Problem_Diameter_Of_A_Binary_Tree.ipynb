    "The diameter of a tree can be defined as the maximum distance between two leaf nodes.\n",
    "Here, the distance is measured in terms of the total number of nodes present along the path of the two leaf nodes, including both the leaves.\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum distance can be seen between the leaf nodes 8 and 9. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distance is 9 as there are a total of nine nodes along the longest path from 8 to 9(inclusive of both). Hence the diameter according to the definition will be 9.\n",

    "Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.\n",
