    "You want to buy a ticket for a well-known concert which is happening in your city. But the number of tickets available is limited. Hence the sponsors of the concert decided to sell tickets to customers based on some priority.\n",

    "A queue is maintained for buying the tickets and every person is attached with a priority (an integer, 1 being the lowest priority).\n",

    "The tickets are sold in the following manner -\n",

    "1. The first person (pi) in the queue requests for the ticket.\n",

    "2. If there is another person present in the queue who has higher priority than pi, then ask pi to move at end of the queue without giving him the ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Otherwise, give him the ticket (and don't make him stand in queue again).\n",
